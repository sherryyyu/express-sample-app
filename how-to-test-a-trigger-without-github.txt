1. What is a Tekton Trigger? What Tekton entities are required for this to work with our Pipeline?

A way to listen to and extract data from events. 

Pipeline run, event listener and route.

1. Since we have not yet added GitHub commit hooks, how did you test your Trigger?

We can use curl to simulate, for example:

curl http://vcs-trigger-sherry-express-sample-app.ibmcloud-roks-8s3d9-8946bbc006b7c6eb0829d088919818bb-0000.hkg02.containers.appdomain.cloud

or 

curl -kvX POST -A "GitHub-Hookshot/github" -H "Content-Type:application/json" -H "X-Github-Event:push" -d @/data/src/github.com/openshift/origin/pkg/build/webhook/github/fixtures/pushevent.json https://10.0.2.15:8443/oapi/v1/namespaces/demo/buildconfigs/centos/webhooks/f-A_pRLVKY5Y6ZfprEyf/github
